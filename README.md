# QMWebClient
Quizmaster Web Client in html and Javascript.
This was used to test the Quizmaster API and has all the functionality so it can be used for live quizzes.
All API interaction uses ajax calls within javascript.
Feel free to fork it but please register a new app id at tcc-quizmaster.appspot.com and update the details at top of file tcc_qm.js
